```
Create two integers, inputNumber and counter
take input from user, and set inputNumber equal to it.
set counter equal to zero.
Loop from 0, or counter, to the value of inputNumber, inclusive of inputNumber
  If counter is 0,
    print 0. (if using the % function to check if 0 is divisible by something, the remainder is always 0 so the check will pass even if it shouldnt.)
  check then if its divisible by 3 and 5.
    if so, print fizzbuzz
  check then if its divisible by 3.
    if so, print fizz
  check then if its divisible by 5.
    if so, print buzz
  otherwise just print the number.
  regardless of output, after each iteration add 1 to counter
```
